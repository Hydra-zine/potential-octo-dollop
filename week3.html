                Summary:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This week was almost entirely just me bashing my head against a wall trying to figure out turn based gameplay

                Organization:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Keeping my files organized was actual hell. They key to making good, expandable projects is having organized code by making
                sure the correct code goes in the right files, and classes.

            <h2>
                Basic Turn-Based Implementation:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I layed down the groundwork for actually implementing the turn based combat. Worked mainly on the barebones structure of the UI, and started working on a few scripts,
                such as a Mage script (used by the mage, obviously) and made a basic enemy. I only got the attack button down, but I know have a very simple battle working. Next week,
                I aim to make magic attacks, actually make the MP bar, and maybe, if I have enough time, make the transition from overworld to battle scene.
