                Summary:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This week was mostly about taking a break for a few days and learning some web development.

            <h2>
                Website:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is my first time I've ever even touched webdev, and it really shows. I'd been prolonging it for a while until I started coding my game...which
                inadvertently made me want to work on something else. I'm pretty happy about what I have so far, especially with only 3 days of web development knowledge.
                I'm hoping to make this website in <i>pristine</i> condition by the time I finish, or at least make decent headway. I'm Also thinking of not updating websites
                for previous weeks, to really show how far I'll go (hopefully ill go far asdjhfgkasjhfgsd).

                More Stuff:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm not gonna waste an entire week yet, I still have more stuff to do. This is <i> secret, <b>elusive</b></i> text you're witnessing right now. Soon it will
                disappear....
