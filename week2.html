                Summary:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This week was mostly about taking a break for a few days and learning some web development.

            <h2>
                Website:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is my first time I've ever even touched webdev, and it really shows. I'd been prolonging it for a while until I started coding my game...which
                inadvertently made me want to work on something else. I'm pretty happy about what I have so far, especially with only 3 days of web development knowledge.
                I'm hoping to make this website in <i>pristine</i> condition by the time I finish, or at least make decent headway. I'm Also thinking of not updating websites
                for previous weeks, to really show how far I'll go (hopefully ill go far asdjhfgkasjhfgsd).

                Basic Turn-Based Implementation:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I layed down the groundwork for actually implementing the turn based combat. Worked mainly on the barebones structure of the UI, and started working on a few scripts,
                such as a Mage script (used by the mage, obviously) and made a basic enemy.

                Other Life Stuff:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Shocking, I have a life. I started having in person driving lessons. Driving is not like mario kart--I learned that the hard way...
                I started going to the gym too! Thinga are thankfully looking good... but enough about me. I aim to complete a beta of my game <i>hopefully</i> 
                by the end of the year.
