                Summary:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This week was mostly about initiating the project. I worked on figuring out how to make a 2.5D game, I made the player and camera movement,
                and even added some dialogue and UI.

            <h2>
                Player Movement:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've made too many player movement scripts to count, so this part was relatively easier compared to the rest. I made an InputActions asset,
                and hooked it up to a basic movement script. The only thing different was, flipping my character whenever I move in the opposite way and
                making sure that the x, y, and z rotations of my character are fixed since i'm making a 2.5D game,

            <h2>
                Camera Movement:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I looooove Cinemachine, it makes life so much easier. I wrote no scripts for camera movement, but still have the ideal camera behavouir I wanted. Absolutely bonkers.
                I don't know why, but I did have a lot of trouble getting the camera to only face my player from the front, and have proper deadzones instead of the
                camera just keeping the character in the middle of the screen the whole time.

            <h2>
                Dialogue:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This took up majority of my week. Brackeys <i>hard</i> carried me. Making dialogue forced me to make an interact script, and a interact manager script. 
                Making things expandable in code is good practice, but also very satisfying, especially when it actually helps you out (i know this is like coding 101
                but still). I made the cool dialogue thingy where each letter pops up one at a time. Im pretty proud about it overall.
