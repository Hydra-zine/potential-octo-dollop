                <p> This project is something I’ve been deeply passionate about. It draws inspiration from some of my favorite games,
                    including Undertale, Omori, and the Persona series. At its core, it will be a turn-based RPG with unique mechanics
                    that build on the genre. I’m aiming for a 2.5D environment with a visual style inspired by games like Octopath 
                    Traveler. The story is the heart of the experience, though I’ll be keeping those details under wraps for now to 
                    avoid potential spoilers.

                <p> To keep myself motivated and consistently moving forward, I’ve decided to create a devlog for this project. My 
                    goal is to post an entry every week. This is actually my first time sharing something publicly online, so it’s 
                    both exciting and a little daunting. I hope you’ll be patient with me as I learn along the way—and thank you 
                    for taking the time to check out this page!

                <p> Hi, my name is Aayan Asif. I’m 18 years old, born and raised in Canada, and currently pursuing a bachelor’s
                    degree in Computer Science. Coding has always been a big part of my life—I even competed in programming contests
                    on sites like Codeforces and DMOJ during high school. I started making games in Unity back in grade 11, and since
                    then I’ve participated in and won a few small local game jams. Up until now, my projects have been relatively 
                    small, but this time I want to take on something bigger and more ambitious.
